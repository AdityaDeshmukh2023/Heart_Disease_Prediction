# Heart_Disease_Prediction

## Overview
This project implements a machine learning model to predict the presence of heart disease using patient data. The model utilizes various algorithms, including Logistic Regression, to analyze and classify the data effectively.

## Highlights
- **Importing Dependencies**: The project begins by importing necessary libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn.
- **Data Collection and Processing**: The dataset is loaded and processed for analysis.
- **Model Training**: The model is trained using training data, and its performance is evaluated.
- **User Interaction**: Users can input their data to receive predictions about heart disease.

## Key Features
- **Data Analysis**: The project includes exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset better.
- **Model Evaluation**: The model's accuracy is assessed using various metrics.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The application allows users to input their health parameters for predictions.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The primary programming language for model development.
- **Libraries**: 
  - NumPy
  - Pandas
  - Scikit-learn
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive development and testing.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training the model can be found in the repository. It contains various health parameters and the target variable indicating the presence of heart disease.
